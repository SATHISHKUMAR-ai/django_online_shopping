Django-online Shopping for python
Most e-commerce systems are shipped with a predefined database model for products. But products can vary a lot, and it simply is impossible to create a model which fits for all of them. This is esspecially true for products with a hierarchy of variants. In many popular e-commerce platforms, you either have far too many attributes per product, and/or the really required attributes are missing.
